# MrBignose5866's Windows Mods

This folder has all the scripts I use day to day in Windows or to setup my system.

App Switcher: Opens and Cycles through my apps instantly <br>
ShareX Capture - CTRL+F5: Makes it so if I hit CTRL+F5 it will start a ShareX region capture, so I don't have to open sharex and do it manually. I could just use the default hotkey for ShareX region capture which is CTRL+PrintScreen, but I want it to be CTRL+F5, plus i like autohotkey. <br>
PowerShell Program Installer - A Advanced Program Installer <br>
always num=on - Forces NumLock to be On <br>
