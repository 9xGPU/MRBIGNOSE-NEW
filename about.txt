This folder has all the scripts I use day to day in Windows or to setup my system.App Switcher: Opens and Cycles through my apps instantlyShareX Capture - CTRL+F5: Makes it so if I hit CTRL+F5 it will start a ShareX region capture, so I don't have to open sharex and do it manually. I could just use the default hotkey for ShareX region capture which is CTRL+PrintScreen, but I want it to be CTRL+F5, plus i like autohotkey. PowerShell Program Installer - A Advanced Program Installer - MrBignose5866
